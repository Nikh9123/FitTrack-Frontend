## 1. What Is Veera? (Plain English)

**Veera** is a mobile fitness app that acts as your **personal AI fitness coach**.

Instead of only counting calories or logging workouts in isolation, Veera brings together:

- **What you eat and drink**
- **How you move** (steps, workouts, sleep)
- **How your body is changing** (weight, InBody scans, measurements)
- **Your goals** (lose fat, build muscle, stay consistent)

… and turns that into **clear daily tips, weekly reviews, monthly reports, achievements, and chat with an AI coach** that understands *your* data.

**Product promise:** *"Your personal AI fitness coach"* — not just a fitness database.

Think of it as combining the best ideas from apps like MyFitnessPal (nutrition), Fitbod/Hevy (workouts), WHOOP/Oura (recovery feel), and Apple Fitness+ (motivation) — with an **AI layer** that reads your progress and tells you what to focus on next.

---

## 2. Who Is It For?

| User type | How they use Veera |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Gym members** | Log workouts, track diet, upload InBody scans, get AI plans and reviews |
| **Fitness beginners** | Guided onboarding, daily score, simple quick actions on Home |
| **Serious lifters** | Workout sessions, personal records (PRs), progression suggestions |
| **People with InBody access** | Scan/upload reports for clinical-grade body composition analysis |
| **Trainers & gym owners** *(roadmap)* | Member management, scheduling, attendance — schema exists, UI partial |

Veera is especially oriented toward **Indian gym-goers** (regional diet options, local food logging) but works for anyone tracking fitness holistically.

---

## 3. Problems Veera Solves

| Problem | Veera's answer |
|---------|-------------------|
| "I log data but don't know what it means" | AI weekly/monthly reviews + daily coach tip |
| "I lose motivation after a few weeks" | Streaks, achievements, journey map, fitness score |
| "My gym gives me InBody printouts I never use" | Upload scan → AI explains body fat, muscle, visceral fat, recommendations |
| "I don't know what to eat or how to train" | AI diet plans, AI workout plans from InBody + goals |
| "Too many apps for diet, gym, and progress" | One app: Home, Workout, Diet, Progress, AI Coach |

---

## 4. How the App Works — User Journey

### First time opening the app

```
Open app → Onboarding slides → Sign up / Log in → Profile setup (goal, height, weight)
→ Land on Home tab
```

### A typical day

1. **Morning** — Open Home: see Daily Score, coach tip, step/calorie/water rings.
2. **During the day** — Log meals (Diet tab), water, steps sync automatically if enabled.
3. **At the gym** — Start workout from Workout tab, log sets/reps, complete session.
4. **Evening** — Check Progress tab for fitness score, journal charts, achievements.
5. **Weekly** — Open Weekly Review (from Progress or Coach) for AI summary of the week.

### InBody journey

```
InBody tab/screen → Upload photo/PDF or estimate from measurements
→ App reads numbers (OCR) → AI writes full analysis
→ Results feed workout plans, progress charts, transformation timeline
```

---

## 5. Main Features Explained Simply

### Home

Your **command center**. Shows greeting, streak, daily score (0–100), coach tip of the day, quick actions (meal, water, weight, train), activity rings, today's workout, weight trend, and activity timeline.

### Workout

Your **training hub**. AI-generated or manual workout plans, live session logging, rest timer, personal records, workout streak, and progression insights.

### Diet

**Food and hydration tracking**. Log meals, see calories/macros vs goals, AI-generated diet plans based on your profile and InBody data.

### Progress

Your **results dashboard**. Fitness score breakdown, fitness journal (steps/calories/sleep/weight charts), transformation summary from InBody, achievements grid, journey map link, AI insights, weekly review banner.

### Analysis

**Body composition focus**. InBody reports, radar-style fitness dimensions, trends from scans.

### AI Coach (Trainer tab)

**Chat with your coach**. Ask questions; the AI uses your profile, recent logs, and (when wired) latest reviews as context. Replies powered by Groq LLM.

### Coach Reports

- **Daily digest** — One tip + one focus action on Home (refreshes each day).
- **Weekly review** — Score, activity breakdown, AI narrative, forecasts, shareable card.
- **Monthly report** — Longer-horizon analysis, transformation timeline, next-month goals.

### Achievements & Journey

**Gamification**. Badges for streaks, workouts, weight milestones. Journey screen shows stages and unlockable titles.

### Gym *(partial)*

Membership, attendance, trainer booking — backend schema ready; member-facing UI evolving.

## 7. System Overview (Big Picture)

Veera is a **client–server** application:

```
┌─────────────────┐         HTTPS / JSON          ┌─────────────────┐
│  Mobile App     │  ◄──────────────────────────► │  Backend API    │
│  (Expo/RN)      │         JWT Auth              │  (Express/TS)   │
└─────────────────┘                               └────────┬────────┘
                                                             │
                    ┌────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
                    ▼                    ▼                   ▼                    ▼
             ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
             │ PostgreSQL   │   │ Supabase     │   │ Groq AI      │   │ OCR / Vision │
             │ (Supabase)   │   │ Storage      │   │ (LLM)        │   │ (InBody)     │
             └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

**In one sentence:** The phone app collects and displays data; the server stores it, runs business logic, and calls AI services when you need analysis or coaching.

## 8. Technical Architecture

### Architectural style

- **Monorepo-style workspace:** `Veera-Frontend/` + `Veera-backend/`
- **REST API** over HTTP (JSON bodies, JWT bearer tokens)
- **Single PostgreSQL database** (no microservices yet)
- **Service layer** on backend — routes are thin, services hold business logic
- **Context + hooks** on frontend — shared state (auth, fitness, achievements)

### Layered backend

```
HTTP Request
    → Route (Express router)
    → Controller (validation, HTTP codes)
    → Service (business logic)
    → Drizzle ORM → PostgreSQL
    → Optional: Groq / Supabase Storage / external APIs
```

### Layered frontend

```
Screen (app/*.tsx)
    → Components (components/*)
    → Hooks (hooks/*) + Context (context/*)
    → API clients (lib/*-api.ts)
    → Backend REST API
```

### Design principles

1. **One source of truth** — Server DB for persistent data; AsyncStorage for auth token cache only.
2. **Reuse over duplicate** — Coach reviews reuse `historyService`, not separate tables.
3. **AI with fallback** — If Groq is unavailable, rule-based narratives still work.
4. **Premium UX** — Rings, gradients, motion, achievements — without changing information architecture.

**Migrations:** Drizzle Kit (`Veera-backend/drizzle/`)  
**~75 tables** across **18 schema domains**

### Domain summary

| Domain | Key tables | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Users** | `users`, `user_profiles`, `auth_sessions` | Identity and profile |
| **Workouts** | `exercises`, `user_workout_plans`, `user_workout_sessions`, `exercise_logs`, `personal_records` | Training data |
| **InBody** | `inbody_reports` | Scans, OCR metrics, AI analysis JSON |
| **Analytics** | `weight_logs`, `activity_summaries`, `daily_checkins`, `goals`, `user_streaks`, `achievement_definitions`, `user_achievements` | Progress & gamification |
| **Diet** | `food_items`, `diet_logs`, `water_logs`, `nutrition_targets`, `diet_plans` | Nutrition |
| **AI** | `ai_plan_requests`, `ai_plan_responses` | Coach reviews, digests, plan requests |

### Coach data storage (no extra domain tables)

Coach reviews and daily digests are stored in existing AI tables:

- `ai_plan_requests.request_type` = `coach_weekly_review` | `coach_monthly_review` | `coach_daily_digest`
- `ai_plan_responses.response_payload` = full JSON review/digest
- One record per user per period (upsert by week/month/day key)

| **Monthly report** | 30-day aggregates, InBody trends, forecasts | Long-form report + timeline |
| **InBody analysis** | OCR metrics + optional scan text | Structured sections (body fat, muscle, risks, plan) |
| **AI trainer chat** | User message + trainer context bundle | Conversational reply |
| **Workout/diet plans** | Profile, InBody, goals | Structured plan JSON |

### AI provider
